            <p class="desc">
                I am a first year student, aiming to earn my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the University of San Carlos. My interest in pursuing such a course stems from my passion in Game Development and Cybersecurity. Although I spend a majority of my leisure time in the game development field and enjoy anything that involves utilizing my imagination, the idea of hacking to protect computer systems intrigued me so much that it felt like I was an actual character in the many games I play. I am open to discovering new things. Challenges give me an anxiety that mixes with excitement. I enjoy watching films, listening to music, and writing stories. I never actually finish what I write, I find so many inspirations that it divides into different plots. But my life is full of ups and downs, it is the only story I have not given up on writing.

            <p class="desc">
                I am a first year BS Computer Science student in the University of San Carlos, having graduated Senior High School from the same school. In the field of technology, I am particularly interested in Game Development and Cybersecurity. However, despite taking this course and diving into the aforementioned fields, I am actually not that big of a ‘gamer’ or ‘tech’ person. My drive to be successful, earn a competitive salary, and give back to my family is what pushed me to pursue this program. What I actually like doing outside of all of this are singing, dancing, sleeping, and dressing up. I am highly interested in makeup and fashion and also do a bit of song making from time to time. What I love the most are the color pink, cats, and my family.

I also love immersing myself in music and unwinding by watching my favorite shows during my free time.

                I am currently studying in the University of San Carlos as a BS Computer Science major. I completed my primary and secondary education in LIDE Learning Center Inc. and graduated valedictorian in the General Academic Strand (GAS). I am an intense knowledge-seeker and I find the Computer Science field an incredibly beautiful world to explore, hence why I enjoy learning new languages and exploring different fields. I love listening to music and musicals, and I never stick to one genre. My goal in life is to be satisfied with what I have achieved.

                I am a Computer Science student currently studying at the University of San Carlos. I graduated Senior High School under the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics strand at San Remigio National High School. I chose this course not only because of its salary rates or current demand, but because I was inspired by my father’s works and wanted to follow in his footsteps. In terms of my career , my interests lie in between app development and game development, with a desire to be part of a team creating or contributing innovative apps or games that could stand out, making people cannot live without.
